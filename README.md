Realized last night that the way I originally set up the Tracker project had problems. I needed to install the simple_form gem much earlier than I had. Fixed it this time around, mostly by following the set up of the SmileBook project.

Core elements of user and check-ins are here now. Next steps include working on views and sign-in/welcome page. Also need to set up the page that shows all of the user's check-ins.

Detailed notes are included in the tracker2.txt file.
